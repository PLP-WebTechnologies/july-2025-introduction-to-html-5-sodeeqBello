      <p> My name is Sodeeq Opeyemi Bello, and I am an aspiring software developer driven by a passion for 
        creating websites that are both accessible and inclusive. I believe that technology has the power 
        to bridge gaps and connect people from all walks of life. I am committed to ensuring that everyone, 
        regardless of their abilities or backgrounds, can enjoy seamless web experiences. I am constantly 
        learning and honing my skills in various programming languages and frameworks, with a particular 
        focus on user-centered design and accessibility standards. My goal is to build applications that not 
        only meet functional requirements but also prioritize usability for all users. </p>

        <h3 id="article-1-title">Understanding Semantic HTML</h3>
        <p>Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML5 elements that convey meaning about the content they enclose. 
            Instead of using generic tags like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, semantic tags 
            such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and
            <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> describe the role and structure of content. This improves accessibility for 
            screen readers, supports better SEO by aiding search engine indexing, and makes code easier for developers 
            to read and maintain. Writing semantic HTML is a best practice that bridges human and machine understanding 
            of web content.

        <h3 id="article-2-title">Why Accessibility Matters</h3>
        <p>Accessible web design ensures that your website can be used by everyone, including people with 
            disabilities such as visual, auditory, or motor impairments. For example, screen reader 
            users rely on semantic HTML, proper heading structure, and attributes like <code>aria-label</code> 
            to understand and navigate web content. Accessible design also supports users who use keyboard 
            navigation or assistive tools. By building inclusive experiences, developers not only meet legal 
            and ethical standards but also reach a broader audience and improve usability for all. Accessibility
            is not an add-on — it’s a core principle of responsible web development.
